"""
geom_ops.py -- loader stub. The real AutoCAD-style editing operations
(Difference, Offset support, Chamfer, Trim, Hatch, etc.) are shipped as
encrypted source only, under backend/_protected/geom_ops.enc -- see
backend/_crypto_loader.py for why and how, and build_protected_backend.py
(in the main project folder, not shipped here) for regenerating it
after an edit.

Everything geom_ops.py has always exposed still works exactly the same
via `import geom_ops` -- this stub just hands the loading off
transparently.
